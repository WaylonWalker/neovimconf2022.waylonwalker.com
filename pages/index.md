## The pitch

Extending vim does not need to be complicated and can be done using cli tools
that you might already be comfortable with.  Examples, setting up
codeformatters with autocmds, using lf/ranger as a tui file manager, generating
new files using a template framework like cookiecutter/copier/yeoman, using ag
to populate your quickfix.
